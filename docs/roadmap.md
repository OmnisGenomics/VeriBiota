# Roadmap

## Current
- Open‑core release (v0.10.2‑pilot): full proof‑to‑certificate chain.
- Deterministic builds; canonicalization + signing; CI tamper harness.

## In progress
- Runtime engine (Rust/CUDA): verified ODE/SSA execution against checks.
- Audit ledger + portal: hosted verification with immutable provenance.

## Near‑term
- Partner integrations across pharma, synthetic biology, and academia.
- Enterprise offerings: private signer, audit ledger, SLA support.

Schemas under `schema/` are treated as immutable per major version. Future changes will ship as `v2` alongside `v1` until migration.
